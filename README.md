## Disclaimer
Please note that this app is still a work in progress. The Brief feature needs final refinements, and the app may not have a polished user interface. We are actively working on improving the app's design and user experience, and appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have.<br /> 
You may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior while using this app!<br />

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.<br />
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/briefing-buzz.git
cd briefing-buzz
npm install
```

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this app, you'll need to install Expo CLI. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## API Keys

To use Briefing Buzz, you will need to obtain API keys for **TWO** services: ONE AI and News API.<br />
<br />
- To get a **ONE AI API key**, visit the [ONE AI website](https://oneai.com/) and sign up for an account. Once you have signed up, you can access your API key in the account settings section.<br />
- To get a **News API key**, visit the [News API website](https://newsapi.org/) and sign up for an account. Once you have signed up, you can access your API key in the dashboard section.<br />
<br />
Once you have obtained both API keys, create a new folder called **config** in the root directory of the project and define a **config.js** file in that folder with the API keys, like this:
```arduino
export const API_KEY = "insert your API key here";
export const ONEAI_API_KEY = "insert your ONEAI API key here";
```
Replace with your actual API keys.
<br />

## Installation
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the app on your local machine.
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the Expo development server and open the app in your default browser. You can then use the Expo app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and view the app.<br />

## Running the App
To run the app on your mobile device, you'll need to download the Expo app from the App Store or Google Play. Once you have the Expo app installed, you can scan the QR code generated by **npm start** and view the app.<br />

## Built With

React Native - A JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps.<br />
React Navigation - A routing and navigation library for React Native apps.<br />
